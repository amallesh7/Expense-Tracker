### Expense Tracker Documentation

#### Overview
The Expense Tracker is a Java-based application designed to help users manage their expenses efficiently. It provides essential features such as user registration, login/logout functionality, adding expenses, listing expenses, and displaying category-wise summations of expenses. The application utilizes object serialization for data persistence.

#### Design

##### Classes
1. **Expense**: Represents an individual expense with properties for date, category, and amount.
2. **User**: Represents a registered user with properties for username, password, and a list of expenses.
3. **ExpenseTracker**: Main class handling the core functionalities of the application, including user management, expense management, data persistence, and interaction with the user interface.
4. **ExpenseTrackerApp**: Entry point for the application, contains the main method to run the Expense Tracker.

##### Data Persistence
- The application uses object serialization to store and retrieve user data, including user profiles and their associated expenses. User data is saved to a file (`expense_data.txt`) upon registration, login, or addition of expenses, and loaded during initialization.

##### User Interface
- The user interface is command-line based, providing a simple menu-driven interaction for users to navigate through different functionalities.
- Users are prompted to input choices and relevant data, such as usernames, passwords, expense details, etc.
- The application provides feedback to users after each operation, informing them about the success or failure of their actions.

#### Features

1. **User Registration and Login**: Users can register with a unique username and password. Upon successful registration, they can log in to access their account.

2. **Adding Expenses**: Logged-in users can add expenses by providing details such as date, category, and amount. Expenses are associated with the current user's account.

3. **Listing Expenses**: Users can list their expenses based on different criteria, including unsorted, sorted by date, or sorted by category.

4. **Category-wise Summation**: Users can view a summary of their expenses grouped by category, displaying the total amount spent in each category.

5. **Data Persistence**: User data, including user profiles and their associated expenses, is stored persistently using object serialization. This ensures that user data is retained across different sessions.

6. **Error Handling**: The application provides basic error handling, such as informing users about invalid inputs or unsuccessful operations. However, there's room for improvement in handling exceptions and providing more informative error messages.

7. **Resource Management**: The application ensures proper resource management by closing file streams and other resources using try-with-resources blocks.

#### Conclusion
The Expense Tracker application provides a simple yet effective solution for managing expenses. It offers essential features for users to register, log in, add expenses, and view summaries of their spending habits. With its command-line interface and object serialization for data persistence, the application offers a convenient way for users to track their finances.
